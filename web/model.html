                                    <p>For success in its aims, ORB must be readily accessible to and useful for facilities managers in as large a number and variety of buildings as possible. While buildings can vary in the number and types of sensors they have installed, aggregated WiFi connection data (i.e. a count of the number of devices connected to WiFi in the building) is ubiquitous and easy-to-access in most buildings. As such, we use WiFi data as a route to determining building occupancy:</p>

                                        <p>The API takes an optimization approach to determining the best start and end times for a given day—</p>
                                        <p>Each day’s wifi connection time series can be treated as a step function, hereafter referred to as <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://render.githubusercontent.com/render/math?math=f(x)"><img src="https://render.githubusercontent.com/render/math?math=f(x)" style="max-width:100%;"></a>. Assuming that connection count is polled at n regular intervals, this series can be divided into <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://render.githubusercontent.com/render/math?math=\frac{n(n-1)}{2}"><img src="https://render.githubusercontent.com/render/math?math=\frac{n(n-1)}{2}" style="max-width:100%;"></a> segments with distinct start time index <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://render.githubusercontent.com/render/math?math=a"><img src="https://render.githubusercontent.com/render/math?math=a" style="max-width:100%;"></a> and end time index <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://render.githubusercontent.com/render/math?math=b"><img src="https://render.githubusercontent.com/render/math?math=b" style="max-width:100%;"></a>, per the triangular number formula. At the standard 5-minute intervals used for polling wifi connection data, there are 41,328 such segments of the day.</p>
                                        <p>Each of these segments cover a portion of the day’s total wifi connections, represented as <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://render.githubusercontent.com/render/math?math=\frac{ \sum_{a}^{b} f(x) }{ \sum f(x) }"><img src="https://render.githubusercontent.com/render/math?math=\frac{ \sum_{a}^{b} f(x) }{ \sum f(x) }" style="max-width:100%;"></a>, a quantity we must maximize to ensure we’re identifying a segment of the day that covers as many connected devices as possible. Each segment also covers a portion of the day’s total time, represented as <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://render.githubusercontent.com/render/math?math=\frac{b-a}{n}"><img src="https://render.githubusercontent.com/render/math?math=\frac{b-a}{n}" style="max-width:100%;"></a>, which we minimize to prevent unnecessary resource allocation. In order to optimize both of these proportions in their respective directions, we maximize their quotient. However, when done naively, this tends to identify a very short segment where the peak number of wifi connections occurred on that day, unfortunately missing many of the day’s connections. To address this, we set a threshold ε, the minimum proportion of wifi connections that must be captured by the segment, which is set to 0.9 by default but is customizable within the API call. This renders the optimizing function as follows:</p>
                                        <p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://render.githubusercontent.com/render/math?math=max \left( \frac{ \frac{ \sum_{a}^{b} f(x) }{ \sum f(x) }}{ \frac{ b-a }{ n }} \right); \frac{ \sum_{a}^{b} f(x) }{ \sum f(x) } &gt; \varepsilon"><img src="https://render.githubusercontent.com/render/math?math=max \left( \frac{ \frac{ \sum_{a}^{b} f(x) }{ \sum f(x) }}{ \frac{ b-a }{ n }} \right); \frac{ \sum_{a}^{b} f(x) }{ \sum f(x) } &gt; \varepsilon" style="max-width:100%;"></a></p>
                                        <p>From a programmatic efficiency perspective, we benefit from a relatively small overall state space of 41,328 segments. As such, we are able to exhaustively search the space by calculating all possible ratios of ratios described above. That said, this is a <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://render.githubusercontent.com/render/math?math=O(n^2)"><img src="https://render.githubusercontent.com/render/math?math=O(n^2)" style="max-width:100%;"></a> approach and would require significantly more resources if the intervals are shorter than 5 minutes or if multiple days are analyzed through this approach in aggregate. To use the brute-force approach in this situation and/or while working with limited computing resources, one may have to set bounds on <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://render.githubusercontent.com/render/math?math=a"><img src="https://render.githubusercontent.com/render/math?math=a" style="max-width:100%;"></a> and <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://render.githubusercontent.com/render/math?math=b"><img src="https://render.githubusercontent.com/render/math?math=b" style="max-width:100%;"></a> to reduce the number of segments being considered or condense the data into fewer intervals, potentially by averaging, summing, or picking one set value from a set of multiple intervals being aggregated. Alternatively, one can utilize a gradient ascent-like approach to exploring the state space, beginning training at the current start and end times used by the building for scheduling and calculating the ratios for surrounding segments to find the path to the optimal maximum—however, we have no guarantees this will converge at an optimal point given the expected variability in the data.</p>
                                        <p>In order to suggest optimal start and end times for a given day of the week, we run the algorithm on specific dates that fell on that day of the week and collect the output start and end times. Thereafter, we select the suggested start time at the <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://render.githubusercontent.com/render/math?math=( 1 - \vartheta )"><img src="https://render.githubusercontent.com/render/math?math=( 1 - \vartheta )" style="max-width:100%;"></a><sup>th</sup> percentile in its series and the suggested end time at the <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://render.githubusercontent.com/render/math?math=\vartheta"><img src="https://render.githubusercontent.com/render/math?math=\vartheta" style="max-width:100%;"></a><sup>th</sup> percentile in its series, where <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://render.githubusercontent.com/render/math?math=\vartheta"><img src="https://render.githubusercontent.com/render/math?math=\vartheta" style="max-width:100%;"></a> is a customizable threshold defaulting to 0.9, in order to represent the best times for that day of the week. This removes the <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://render.githubusercontent.com/render/math?math=( 1 - \vartheta )"><img src="https://render.githubusercontent.com/render/math?math=( 1 - \vartheta )" style="max-width:100%;"></a> proportion of outlier results that may appear, such as holidays and other abnormal differences in occupancy.</p>

                                    <p>The analysis endpoint takes a passed-in set of WiFi connection data and analyzes it on aggregate in order to suggest a scheduled start time and end time for resources on each day of the week, including Saturday and Sunday. In its approach, each of the 11 change point detection models described above are utilized to estimate a number of start times and end times for each date in the passed-in dataset. The 10th percentile is calculated from the large resulting list of determined start times for each day, and the 90th percentile is calculated from the resulting list of determined end times for each day. This provides the user with an ideal start and end time for each day of the week, covering 90% of instances of that day of the week based on historical data and excluding any outliers that arise in change point detection.</p>

                                    <p>The prediction endpoint takes a passed-in set of WiFi connection data as well as a specific future date and suggests a scheduled start time and end time for resources on that specific date. In order to do so, it uses Facebook's <a href='https://facebook.github.io/prophet/'>Prophet</a> forecasting library to project WiFi connection data for the specified date, taking advantage of the library's ability to forecast cyclical time series with resiliency to holidays. Thereafter, the change point detection and percentile calculation described under analysis above is applied to the projected trend for the date in question and the 10th percentile of projected start times as well as 90th percentile of projected end times from the 11 models is returned as output.</p>

                                    <h3 class="block-title">Model Validation</h3>
                                    <p>For many publications that model building occupancy or energy usage, the ground truth is drawn from one of two places: either a human ticker stands outside entrances and collects data on when people enter and exit the building (a very expensive collection), or security camera footage is used to denote when people enter, exit, or move throughout the building (large amount of data storage). The footage can be reviewed manually, or an algorithm can be applied to images to recognize when a person is in frame. Not all building managers have access to this data, so may need to build a ground truth from other sensors.
                                    </p><p>
                                    For the building that the wifi data used for modeling came from, there was also data from other sensor types. By combining all of these sensor data together, a ground truth can be synthesized. Each sensor type needed to be cleaned and formatted so that they could be combined. Because wifi data was taken in 5-minute intervals, any events need to also be rounded to 5-minute intervals and then filled in for all other parts of the interval.
                                    </p>
                                    <h4>Lights</h4>
                                    <p>Light sensors are, assuming no malfunctioning or “bad” sensors, the most accurate way to determine whether a room is occupied. There were hundreds of these sensors in the building, and record whether the light is off or on. Any lights that were on more than 5% of the time between midnight and 3 AM were removed from the dataset, because they would imply occupancy at nearly all times of the day. This removal still left around 150 sensors. The last adjustment was to sum up the number of sensors and if there was more than 1 light on (allowing for a “bad” sensor or a custodian or guard to quickly enter a hallway and leave), then occupancy was marked.</p>
                                    <h4>Accoustic sensors</h4>
                                    <p>Accoustic sensors measure the sound, ostensibly in decibels, in a room. Some rooms may have a base sound level, especially if there is equipment continuously running, as in a server room. For this particular building, the base level was 52 dB, which is about the noise level of a refrigerator/freezer. The decibel scale is logarithmic, so increases to around 60-70 decibels would mean that there is a lot of additional noise. The maximum difference over each floor per date is found and thresholded to 5 dB for occupancy.</p>
                                    <h4>Freezer Doors</h4>
                                    <p>Freezer door sensors are event-based instead of on interval, and record when a freezer door is opened. The logic is that an occupant would be required to open or close the freezer door, so the building would be occupied at the time of these events. The times are rounded to five-minute intervals and then any joined onto the full spread of five-minute intervals.</p>
                                    <h4>Fumehood Airflow</h4>
                                    <p>The fumehood airflow, much like the freezers, changes when a person is present to raise or lower the fumehood. By taking the absolute difference, it is possible to see when the fumehoods were raised or lowered. There needs to be some threshold to account for small changes in the airflow not caused by raising or lowering of the hood, so here 100 is chosen. Other buildings may have different airflows that would require a different threshold.</p>
                                    <h4>Water Flow</h4>
                                    <p>Water flow is measured for the whole building in gallons per minute. Some buildings may have continuous water flowing, but generally it is when someone uses the bathroom or kitchen, or if there is equipment that requires water to flow through for a supervised experiment. The assumption is that if water is flowing, a person should be present to have caused that.</p>
                                    <h4>Access Card Scans</h4>
                                    <p>Access card scans occur when a person attempts to access either a specific room in the building, or the building itself; for this, each scan is labeled as internal or external, as well as whether or not the door was opened after scanning. These scans have timestamps that have to be rounded to the nearest 5 minutes, and if there are multiple scans that get rounded to the same timestamp, the duplicate is removed (i.e. counts do not matter). Additional logic can be applied that if an internal scan occurs without having an external scan right beforehand, occupancy is inferred between the internal scan and the previous scan.</p>
                                    <p>All of this data is combined by removing the timezone from the datetime index, since the time of day is consistent, just either in Pacific Time or UTC. If any of the above sensors show occupation, the timestamp is marked as occupied. In order to prevent occupation defined as something such as a maintenance worker’s midnight security scan, a windowing function is used. To be considered occupied, the timestamp must be marked occupied and for the one hour surrounding the timestamp, there must be occupation at least half the time. A previous iteration used the half hour window and did not require occupation on the timestamp in question, so the start and end times were up to 15 minutes extended.
                                    </p><p>
                                    The ground truth assumes constant occupation between the first and last occupied timestamps, so the only important pieces of data become the “start time” and “end time” for each day. These start and end times can then be compared to predicted start and end times from the wifi data, as well as the actual HVAC run times for the day.
                                    </p>
